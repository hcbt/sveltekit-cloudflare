# sveltekit-cloudflare

Template project with sveltekit, tailwind and svimg ready to deploy on cloudflare pages.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

svimg preprocess images stored in static/images folder during the deployment process or when you start development server.

## Deployment

To deploy your app, you just need to setup cloudflare pages, connect your github account and select this repository to deploy from. :)
